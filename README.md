A command-line tool for converting Ethereum wallets from:
- [distributed](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-distributed)
- [non-deterministic](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-nd)
- [hierarchical deterministic](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-hd)

to:

- [distributed](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-distributed)
- [non-deterministic](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-nd)

> [!CAUTION]
> It is highly recommended to refrain from any operations on the validation keys and use the provided script only in critical situations to avoid any ponential risks of slashing.

## Install

### Binaries

Binaries for the latest version of `dkc` can be obtained from [the releases page](https://github.com/p2p-org/dkc/releases/latest).

### Nix

If you have nix flakes enabled you can run `dkc` using this command:

```sh
$ nix run github:p2p-org/dkc
```

### Source

`dkc` can be built locally using the command

```sh
$ go build .
```

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> Before you begin, make sure you backup keys and store recovered wallets and passwords securely.

`dkc` uses [herumi/bls-eth-go-binary](https://github.com/herumi/bls-eth-go-binary). You can test `dkc` on predefiened inputs [here](.github/workflows/func-tests.yml). 

### Config

An example config for each pair could be found [here](.github/examples/)

The example below shows how to convert wallets from `distributed` type to `hierarchical deterministic` type. 

`base-dir` for `distributed` wallets is located in `./i_wallet` see more info about `distributed` wallet file structure [here](#distributed)

`base-dir` for `hierarchical deterministic` wallets is located in `./o_wallet` see more info about `hierarchical deterministic` wallet file structure [here](#hierarchical-deterministic)

```yaml
input:                              #Input section
  store:                            #Store section
    path: ./i_wallet                #Location of input wallets
  wallet:                           #Wallet section
    type: distributed               #Type for input wallet. Valid types are: distributed, non-deterministic,hierarchical deterministic
    threshold: 2                    #Threshold number. It must be len(peers)/2 < threshold < len(peers) 
    peers:                          #Peers section
      10:                           #Peer ID is used for generating bls participants
        name: old1:9091             #Peer name is used for generating bls participants. All wallets for this peer are located in ./i_wallet/old1
        passphrases:                #Passphrases section
         path: ./peer1.txt          #Path to passphrases file(you can use separate passphrases file for each peer)
         index: 1                   #Password index in passphrases file. If not provided will use all passwords for unlocking wallets and only first password for creating accounts (Default: Using all passwords provided in passphrases file)
      20: 
        name: old2:9091
        passphrases: 
         path: ./peer2.txt
         index: 1
      30:
        name: old3:9091
        passphrases: 
         path: ./peer3.txt
         index: 1
output:                             #Output Wallet Section
  store:
    path: ./o_wallet
  wallet:
    type: hierarchical deterministic
    passphrases:                    
      path: ./o_passphrases.txt
log-level: debug                    #Log-level (Default: INFO)
```

### File Structure

#### Distributed

This wallet type can be used as input or output wallet. More information about this wallet type is provided [here](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-distributed)

The following is an [example](.github/examples/distributed-to-nd/distributed) file structure if one were to combine threshold keys. `test1`, `test2`, `test3` are each the `base-dir` wallet directory from the dirk instance. `test1`, `test2`, `test3` are each their own wallet directory. 

`ethdo wallet list --base-dir ./distributed-to-nd/distributed` should return nothing.

The subdirectories of `wallet` folder are the actual `ethdo` wallets: 

```
$ ethdo wallet list --base-dir distributed-to-nd/distributed/test1
Wallet2
Wallet3
Wallet1
$ ethdo wallet list --base-dir distributed-to-nd/distributed/test2
Wallet2
Wallet3
Wallet1
$ ethdo wallet list --base-dir distributed-to-nd/distributed/test3
Wallet1
Wallet2
Wallet3
```

*Importantly, the names of each wallet folder must correspond with the values in `*.wallet.peers` defined in the config.*

The keys within each wallet must also have the same name

All of the keys with corresponding names (ex: `name = 1`) should be the threshold keys corresponding to the same composite public key. 

#### Hierarchical Deterministic

This wallet type can be used only ad input wallet. More information about this wallet type is provided [here](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-hd)

The following is an [example](.github/examples/hd-to-distributed/hd) file structure. The `base-dir` wallet directory is `hd-to-distributed/hd` 

```
$ ethdo wallet --base-dir hd-to-distributed/hd list
Wallet1
Wallet3
Wallet2
```


#### Non-Deterministic

This wallet type can be used as input or output wallet. More information about this wallet type is provided [here](https://github.com/wealdtech/go-eth2-wallet-nd)

The following is an [example](.github/examples/nd-to-distributed/nd) file structure. The `base-dir` wallet directory is `hd-to-distributed/nd` 

```
$ ethdo wallet --base-dir nd-to-distributed/hd list
Wallet1
Wallet3
Wallet2
```

### Convert

After preparing config and backuping keys simply run:

```sh
./dkc convert --config=config.yaml
```
